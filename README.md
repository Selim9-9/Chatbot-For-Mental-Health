## Local Setup

If you want to run the chatbot locally, please follow these steps:

1. **Download the Pretrained Word2Vec Model:**  
   The chatbot uses a pretrained model named `GoogleNew-Negatie-300.bin`.  
   - **Download Link:** [GoogleNew-Negatie-300.bin](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sandreds/googlenewsvectorsnegative300)  
   _*Make sure to download this file before running the project.*_

2. **Install Required Packages:**  
   All necessary packages are listed in the `requirements.txt` file. You can install them by running the following command in your terminal (works for Windows, macOS, and Linux):

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Notebooks & Dataset on Kaggle:**  
   The two notebooks for this project and the new dataset generated are available on Kaggle:
   - [Notebook 1](#)
   - [Notebook 2](#)
   - [Dataset](#)

## Data Augmentation

This project also includes a `data_augmentation` folder where additional experiments were conducted in a separate environment.

- **Install Data Augmentation Dependencies:**  
  The `data_augmentation` folder contains its own `requirements.txt` file. To install the necessary packages, run:

  ```bash
  pip install -r data_augmentation/requirements.txt
  ```
